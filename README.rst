Video recording
---------------

Choose a license.

See the following note from Ewa:



   We want to remind you all to review your speaker agreements and YouTube licenses
   to ensure they reflect the intentions of   your event. 

   The Creative Commons license (https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en)
   allows others to edit the videos you post. If you choose to go the route of Creative Commons,
   you should check that your speaker agreement allows this type of license arrangement. 

   The YouTube Standard license allows sharing your content via play lists, unedited.

   We are not suggesting one way or another, we want to present the facts and let
   you all decide what works best for your event. PyCon US recently experienced a
   situation that ended with us changing our YouTube license from Creative Commons
   to the Standard YouTube license. We want all organizers to be informed of the options and consequences of each.
